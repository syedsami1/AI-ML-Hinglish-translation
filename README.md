# AI/ML - Translation Task

Welcome to the AI ML - Translation Task repository! This task is part of AI/ML assignment and focuses on translating English text into Hinglish, ensuring that the translation is both natural and easily understandable for non-native Hindi speakers. Additionally, specific English words and phrases will be selectively translated into Hinglish.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that demonstrates the use of the translation function.
- `translation.py`: The module containing the selective translation function.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Translation

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the main script `main.py`:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The script will display the original English texts and their corresponding Hinglish translations.

### Customizing the Translation

You can customize the selective word translation by editing the `translation.py` file. In the `selective_hinglish_translate` function, you can add, modify, or remove words and their Hinglish equivalents in the `translation_dict`.
